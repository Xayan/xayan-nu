## Intro

Europe is running a fascinating experiment: can you build parallel societies while pretending you're doing the opposite?

Turns out, yes. Quite easily, actually.

The ingredients are simple, the instructions straightforward, and the results... well, we're living in them.

What follows is a recipe. Not a conspiracy theory - those require coordination. This is just what happens when legitimacy decays and nobody wants to admit it.

## Ingredients

### Idealism

Start with the belief that humans are blank slates. That culture is costume, not code. That given the right welfare state and enough school programs, a Pashtun tribesman and a Stockholm bureaucrat will converge on identical values.

This isn't malice - it's worse. It's genuine belief in the power of good intentions over empirical patterns.

### Universalism

As I covered in my [asylum post](/posts/asylum-system-is-broken/), liberal universalism functions as secular religion. Western values aren't presented as *one option among many* - they're *universal truths* waiting to be discovered by everyone, eventually, inevitably.

The irony: claiming your values are universal while calling those who disagree "culturally backward" is itself a form of cultural imperialism. But pointing this out makes you the colonizer, somehow.

### Tribalism

Humans are tribal. Always have been, always will be.

Western societies spent centuries building institutions strong enough to override tribal instincts - at least among their own populations. It worked because everyone involved had roughly similar starting conditions and bought into the same social contract.

Then they imported populations that never left tribalism, assumed exposure to Western institutions would fix it, and acted surprised when clan networks outcompeted atomized individuals.

The beautiful part: while suppressing European identity as "dangerous nationalism," they celebrated ethnic solidarity in migrant communities as "maintaining cultural heritage."

Symmetry is for suckers, apparently.

### Freedom of Movement

Add unrestricted movement via Schengen, plus asylum frameworks that make deportation nearly impossible. This creates a one-way valve: easy in, hard out.

The system selects for those willing to game it. The honest migrant applying through legal channels waits years. The one who crosses illegally and claims asylum gets fast-tracked.

Freedom of movement without freedom to exclude isn't freedom - it's just a slower form of conquest.

### Diffusion of Responsibility

Finally: ensure nobody can be held accountable by distributing decisions across multiple layers.

EU sets policy but can't enforce. National governments blame Brussels. Local authorities say they're just implementing orders. NGOs claim independence while taking government money. Courts interpret vague laws however they please.

When something fails - and it will - everyone points at someone else. The machine grinds forward because stopping would require someone to take responsibility.

And nobody wants that job.

## Instructions

*When legitimacy decays, parallel structures bloom.*

That's the thesis. What follows are the mechanisms.

### Hawala

Informal value transfer. Cash goes to a hawaladar in Berlin, comes out in Karachi. No banks, no records, no taxes.

European authorities know it exists. They can't stop it. How do you prosecute trust networks that leave no evidence? How do you infiltrate family bonds that span continents?

You don't. So hawala flourishes, enabling tax evasion, sanctions bypass, and terror financing - all invisible to the state.

The same freedom of movement that allows people also allows money. Integration requires economic ties to the host country. Hawala prevents that.

### Halakha

Jewish religious courts - *batei din* - handle disputes in Orthodox communities. Marriage, divorce, inheritance, business. Voluntary in theory. Mandatory in practice via social pressure.

This establishes the template: religious law can coexist with state law. When community enforcement makes secular rulings irrelevant, you have a parallel legal system whether the state admits it or not.

Small communities, minimal problem. But the framework is portable.

### Sharia

Scale the halakha model to larger populations, add explicit claims of superiority over secular law, and you get sharia councils operating across European cities.

The UK officially recognizes them as "alternative dispute resolution." Sounds voluntary. Except women pressured by families, divorces that grant fewer rights than UK law, community enforcement that makes formal law irrelevant.

When a woman in Berlin can't remarry without a sharia divorce, when a man in Marseille faces social punishment for using French courts - that's not voluntary arbitration. That's a parallel legal system.

The mechanisms are identical to halakha. Just impossible to ignore at scale.

### Factional Media

Parallel societies need parallel realities.

A Turk in Berlin watches TRT, follows Turkish Twitter, discusses politics in Turkish WhatsApp groups. His enemies are Turkey's enemies. Germany is just where he cashes welfare checks.

An Arab in Paris gets news from Al Jazeera, religious instruction from YouTube imams, grievance narratives from diaspora media. Integration becomes cultural genocide when your information ecosystem frames it that way.

Mainstream European media helps by refusing to report migrant crime accurately (racism!), amplifying grievances (proving their progressive credentials), and treating criticism as extremism (providing ammunition for victim narratives).

When different communities inhabit different realities, they aren't living in the same society. They're just occupying the same geography.

## Results

### Bypassing State Authority

Combine informal finance, parallel law, and isolated media. State authority becomes optional.

Police can't investigate cash economies. Courts can't adjudicate disputes settled privately. Regulators can't inspect ethnic business networks. Tax authorities can't collect from hawala-routed income.

When authorities try to enforce? Accusations of racism. NGOs lawyer up. Media runs stories about "vulnerable communities." Bureaucrats stop trying.

Better to pretend the problem doesn't exist than face the optics.

### Ghettoization

Physical separation follows social separation.

When communities run their own finance, law, and media, they don't need the broader society. Clustering amplifies this - economic efficiency, social enforcement, religious density, safety in numbers.

Natives leave. Property values drop. More migrants move in. The neighborhood tips.

Turkish Berlin, Pakistani Birmingham, Algerian Paris, Moroccan Rotterdam. The universalists call this "diversity" and celebrate it.

Within each ghetto? Monoculture.

### Fragmentation of Legal Systems

European law assumes individuals are the unit of responsibility. That violence is monopolized by the state. That law applies universally. That disputes are public, not private.

When communities reject these assumptions - when honor codes override written law, when families bear collective punishment, when crimes are settled through blood money, when vigilantes enforce norms - the legal system doesn't just fail. It becomes incomprehensible to both sides.

A prosecutor brings honor violence charges. The family doesn't understand why the state interferes in private matters. The state doesn't understand why the family sees nothing wrong.

Both think the other is insane. Because they're operating from incompatible paradigms.

And since admitting this would be racist, the incomprehension is never addressed.

### Loss of Social Trust

High-trust societies require assumptions: neighbors share your values, institutions are neutral, cooperation is mutual, strangers are trustworthy.

Parallel societies destroy all of this.

Scandinavian countries watch their famous trust collapse. Swedes who left doors unlocked now install security systems. Not just because of crime - because the social contract is void.

The Nordic model was built on homogeneity. Not racism - just the reality that welfare states require high trust. People accept high taxes for generous benefits when they trust everyone plays by the same rules.

When parallel societies openly game the system - welfare while working cash jobs, disability while running businesses, housing fraud through extended families - trust evaporates.

You can have a welfare state or open borders. Pick one.

### Two-Tier Policing

Rotherham: Pakistani grooming gangs. Police ignored mass sexual abuse for years to avoid appearing racist.

Cologne 2015/16: Mass sexual assault by migrant men. Police tried suppressing reports.

French banlieues: Cars burn yearly. Police don't respond - entering risks escalation.

Swedish no-go zones: Bombings and shootings. No witnesses cooperate.

Pattern: when enforcing law against migrant communities might cause friction, authorities back down.

This creates perverse incentives. If you're in a parallel society, you learn you can get away with more. If you're native, you learn law enforcement is only strict with you.

Equal treatment under law is the social contract's foundation. Two-tier policing destroys it. And once destroyed, it doesn't come back.

### No-Go Zones

The French government denies they exist. They prefer "*zones urbaines sensibles*" - sensitive urban zones.

Except:
- Police only enter with tactical gear
- Ambulances require escort
- Firefighters get attacked responding to (often deliberately set) fires
- Postal workers refuse certain addresses
- Utility workers need armed guards

If government employees won't go somewhere without protection, it's a no-go zone. Call it whatever helps you sleep.

Sweden has them. France has them. Germany, Belgium, Netherlands - all have them.

But remember: they don't exist. Observing reality is far-right extremism now.

The zones are expanding. Second and third-generation migrants double down on parallel structures instead of assimilating. Why wouldn't they? It works.

Give it another generation, these won't be "no-go zones." They'll just be... elsewhere. Geographically in Europe, functionally somewhere else entirely.

## Conclusions

There's your recipe.

**Ingredients**: Idealism about human nature, universalism that denies cultural differences, tribalism you suppress in natives but celebrate in newcomers, freedom of movement without freedom to exclude, diffusion of responsibility across ungovernable layers.

**Instructions**: Layer in hawala for finance, religious courts for law, factional media for reality. Bake at the temperature of political correctness until enforcement becomes impossible.

**Results**: Ghettoization. Parallel legal systems. Collapsed trust. Two-tier policing. No-go zones. Terror attacks (see above).

The tragic part isn't that this was unpredictable. Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Cyprus - all the precedents were there. Mixing incompatible populations and demanding "diversity" produces fragmentation. Always has.

But European elites thought they were different. Smarter. Immune to patterns that apply everywhere else.

They weren't.

So is this reversible?

Theoretically, yes. Practically? Requires admitting the problem exists (breaking ideological taboos), identifying who's responsible (overcoming diffusion of accountability), taking decisive action (weathering accusations of fascism), and sustaining it (political will democracies can't maintain).

Each step is harder than the last. Most countries can't manage step one.

Here's the symmetry nobody wants to acknowledge: the universalists became what they feared. They're the dogmatic zealots now, labeling dissent as extremism, enforcing orthodoxy through social pressure, demanding conformity to their values while celebrating "diversity."

They suppressed European identity as dangerous while importing populations with strong ethnic solidarity. They demanded natives abandon tribalism while empowering communities that never left it. They criminalized nationalism in their own people while funding it in others.

And when parallel societies emerged - exactly as predicted - they responded by doubling down. More diversity programs. More integration funding. More accusations that noticing the problem is the problem.

It's almost beautiful in its dysfunction.

So what happens next?

The parallel societies will continue expanding. Natives will retreat - physically to areas not yet tipped, psychologically into denial. Demographics will shift. Institutions will adapt (read: capitulate). Social fabric will fragment further.

Eventually Europeans will wake up in countries that are European in name only. At which point the question won't be "How did this happen?" We know. We watched. Some of us wrote it down as it occurred.

The question will be: "Why did we let it?"

And the uncomfortable answer: stopping it would have required questioning beliefs held sacred. Better to sacrifice a civilization than admit you were wrong about human nature.

*Ad melius futurum.* 

Though honestly? I'm not holding my breath.

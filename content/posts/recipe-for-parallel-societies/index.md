## Intro

Europe is conducting a fascinating social experiment: can you maintain a cohesive society while actively destroying every mechanism that creates cohesion?

The results are in. No, you cannot.

In recent years, Europe has witnessed the emergence of parallel societies - communities that operate outside traditional state authority and legal frameworks. This isn't happening by accident. It's the predictable result of combining ideological blindness with institutional incompetence.

Migration, globalization, and identity politics aren't the *causes* of this phenomenon - they're the *mechanisms*. The cause is simpler: **Europe's elites chose this.**

Here's how this came to happen - a partial explanation at best, but it covers the main components.

## Ingredients

### Idealism

The first ingredient is a heavy dose of idealism - the kind that makes you believe that all humans are fundamentally good, and that any conflict or tension is just a misunderstanding waiting to be resolved through dialogue and education.

This naive worldview assumes that cultural differences are superficial, that values are negotiable, and that everyone secretly wants the same things: peace, prosperity, and progressive Western values.

It's the kind of thinking that dismisses historical patterns, ignores empirical evidence, and treats realpolitik as a dirty word. After all, who needs pragmatism when you have *good intentions*?

The idealists believe that providing welfare, education, and economic opportunities will magically dissolve cultural boundaries and transform everyone into model Western citizens. They see integration as a one-way process of assimilation - not realizing that cultures don't just blend, they compete.

### Universalism

Next, add a generous helping of universalism - the philosophical cousin of idealism.

As I explored in my piece on [the broken asylum system](/posts/asylum-system-is-broken/), **liberal universalism** operates as a quasi-religious belief system. It posits that Western democratic values aren't just *preferred* - they're *universal truths* that all humans will eventually embrace, given the right circumstances.

This worldview refuses to acknowledge that some cultures have fundamentally incompatible values. That some societies don't value individual liberty over collective identity. That some belief systems don't separate church and state, or law and religion.

The universalists see cultural relativism as a temporary condition, not a permanent state. They believe that exposure to Western institutions will inevitably lead to convergence on Western values. Any resistance is dismissed as ignorance, poverty, or manipulation by bad actors.

It's an oddly colonial mindset for people who claim to oppose colonialism. They want to reshape the world in their image, but call it "liberation" instead of conquest.

### Tribalism

Many people like to pretend that tribalism is a thing of the past.

That it's something that only existed in ancient times, in small, isolated communities.

That it can be eradicated through education, economic development, and the spread of so-called "pluralism".

**They're wrong.**

From neolithic tribes, through the fall of Rome, and to modern nation-states - tribalism has been a constant in human history. You can try to suppress it, but it will always find a way to manifest itself.

Tribalism is the default human operating system. We're hardwired to distinguish between in-group and out-group, to trust our own and suspect the other, to compete for resources along group lines. Ten thousand years of civilization haven't erased these instincts - they've just redirected them.

Modern Western societies tried to transcend tribalism by building identity around ideas and institutions rather than ethnicity and kinship. It worked, sort of, as long as:
- The population was relatively homogeneous
- Everyone bought into the social contract
- Institutions were seen as legitimate and neutral

But what happens when you import populations that never abandoned tribalism? That organize along clan and ethnic lines? That view institutional authority as illegitimate unless it's controlled by their group?

You get a competition between post-tribal and tribal societies. And the tribal ones have an advantage: **solidarity without ideology**.

While native Europeans are atomized individuals debating pronouns and universal values, migrant communities operate as cohesive units. They pool resources, enforce norms, punish defectors, and advance group interests. It's not a conspiracy - it's just how humans naturally organize when tribal identity remains strong.

The universalists thought they could suppress European tribalism while welcoming populations with strong tribal identities, and somehow everyone would converge on post-tribal individualism.

Instead, they suppressed the only group that had transcended tribalism, while empowering groups that never left it.

Brilliant strategy. Really.

### Freedom of Movement

Now we need a mechanism for turning theoretical idealism into practical chaos: unrestricted freedom of movement.

The Schengen Agreement abolished internal borders in much of Europe, creating a zone where anyone can travel freely. Combined with asylum frameworks that make deportation nearly impossible, this creates a one-way valve: easy to enter, hard to remove.

This isn't just about migration numbers - it's about the *type* of migration. When movement is unrestricted and residency is guaranteed through asylum claims (valid or not), you don't get the self-selected, highly-motivated immigrants who integrate successfully. You get a mix that includes people who have no intention of integrating at all.

The system actively selects for those willing to game it. The honest migrant who applies through legal channels and waits years gets passed by the one who crosses illegally and claims asylum. The person who wants to adopt Western values competes for resources with those who want to recreate their home country's social structures.

Freedom of movement without freedom to exclude is just an invitation to be colonized in reverse.

### Diffusion of Responsibility

The final ingredient is diffusion of responsibility - a bureaucratic masterpiece where nobody is accountable because everyone shares the blame.

When decisions about migration, asylum, and integration are made at multiple levels - EU, national, regional, local - with overlapping jurisdictions and contradictory mandates, you create a system where no single actor can be held responsible for failures.

The EU sets broad policies but can't enforce them. National governments complain they're constrained by EU law. Local authorities say they're just implementing national policy. NGOs operate with government funding but claim independence. International organizations issue non-binding recommendations that somehow become binding through judicial interpretation.

This diffusion serves a purpose: it insulates policymakers from consequences. When a policy fails - when parallel societies emerge, when integration doesn't happen, when social tensions rise - there's always someone else to blame.

The voters can't punish their government because "Brussels made us do it." Brussels can't be punished because it's not directly elected on these issues. The courts can't be touched because they're "independent." And the whole machine keeps grinding forward, because stopping it would require someone to take responsibility.

Nobody steers the ship, but everyone insists they're just following orders.

## Instructions

### Hawala

**Hawala** is an informal value transfer system that operates entirely outside the traditional banking infrastructure. No paper trail, no regulatory oversight, just trust-based networks that move money across borders invisibly.

Here's how it works: You give cash to a hawaladar in Berlin. He contacts his associate in Karachi. The associate pays out the equivalent amount to your family. No banks, no records, no taxes, no questions. The debt between the two hawaladars is settled later through other transactions or legitimate trade.

For parallel societies, this is perfect. It enables:

- **Tax evasion** - Income earned in Europe never appears in any official records
- **Sanctions bypass** - Money flows to and from countries under embargo
- **Terror financing** - Funds reach destinations without triggering any alerts  
- **Economic isolation** - Entire communities can operate financially separate from the host country

European authorities know about hawala networks but struggle to combat them. How do you prosecute a system that leaves no evidence? How do you infiltrate networks built on family and tribal bonds that span generations?

The beautiful irony: the same freedom of movement that allows people to migrate also allows money to flow back, sustaining economic ties to home countries and preventing integration.

### Halakha

**Halakha** - Jewish religious law - provides the template for religious legal systems operating alongside secular law.

In some Orthodox Jewish communities across Europe, rabbinical courts (*batei din*) handle disputes over marriage, divorce, inheritance, and business matters. These rulings carry social weight within the community, even when they contradict secular law.

The system relies on voluntary submission - theoretically. In practice, social pressure and community enforcement make these courts almost mandatory for observant members. Refusing to accept a rabbinical court's judgment can mean ostracization, loss of business relationships, and exclusion from community institutions.

This isn't necessarily problematic when the community is small and self-regulating. But it establishes a precedent: **religious law can coexist with, and sometimes supersede, state law.**

The pattern:
1. Community establishes religious courts for "internal matters"
2. Social pressure makes participation effectively mandatory
3. Religious rulings contradict secular law but are enforced through informal means
4. State authorities tolerate it in the name of religious freedom
5. The parallel legal system becomes institutionalized

What works for Halakha can work for any religious legal system. The framework is portable.

### Sharia

**Sharia** - Islamic law - scales the halakha model to much larger populations with a crucial difference: it explicitly claims superiority over secular law.

Across European cities, sharia councils and Islamic arbitration tribunals operate semi-openly. They handle family law, inheritance, finance, and increasingly, criminal matters through "restorative justice."

Unlike halakha, which generally accepts its subordinate position to state law (even if grudgingly), sharia courts often operate on the premise that Islamic law is divinely mandated and therefore superior to man-made legislation. This creates a fundamentally different dynamic.

Case study: the UK officially recognizes sharia councils as alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Sounds reasonable - voluntary arbitration, right? Except:

- Women are pressured by families to accept sharia tribunals instead of secular courts
- Sharia divorce often grants women fewer rights than UK law
- "Voluntary" submission isn't so voluntary when community enforcement mechanisms are in play
- The same institutions issuing rulings also control access to Islamic marriage, making compliance essential

Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands - all have similar systems developing. Each country insists these are just "voluntary" religious services, not parallel legal systems.

But when a woman in Berlin can't get remarried in her community without a sharia divorce, when a man in Marseille is socially punished for taking a dispute to French courts instead of an imam, when community enforcement makes secular law irrelevant - you have a parallel legal system, whether you admit it or not.

The mechanisms are identical to halakha, just implemented at a scale that makes them impossible to ignore.

### Factional Media

The final mechanism: **media ecosystems that operate entirely separate from mainstream discourse.**

Parallel societies don't just need parallel legal and financial systems - they need parallel information ecosystems. When communities consume media exclusively in their heritage language, from sources in their countries of origin or from diaspora outlets, they inhabit a different reality than their neighbors.

A Turk in Berlin watches TRT, follows Turkish Twitter, and discusses politics on Turkish WhatsApp groups. His information diet is entirely Turkish, his reference points are Turkish politics, his enemies are Turkey's enemies. Germany is just where he happens to live and collect welfare.

An Arab in Paris gets news from Al Jazeera, entertainment from Arabic satellite TV, religious instruction from YouTube imams. French current events are filtered through Arabic-language diaspora media that frames everything through grievance narratives.

This isn't just about language - it's about **reality tunnels**. When your media tells you that Europeans are crusaders, that Western law is corrupt, that your community is perpetually victimized, that integration is cultural genocide - you don't integrate. You resist.

The mainstream European media helps by:
- Refusing to report accurately on migrant crime (for fear of "racism")
- Amplifying grievance narratives to demonstrate progressive credentials
- Treating any criticism of parallel societies as far-right extremism
- Providing ammunition for diaspora media's victim narratives

Social media accelerated this process. Now you don't even need satellite dishes. Facebook groups, Telegram channels, WhatsApp networks - entire communities can communicate, organize, and radicalize without ever engaging with the host society's information sphere.

When you control the information ecosystem, you control reality. And when different communities inhabit different realities, they aren't living in the same society - they're just occupying the same geography.

## Results

### Bypassing State Authority and Regulations

When you combine informal financial systems, parallel legal structures, and isolated media ecosystems, state authority becomes... optional.

Why pay taxes when hawala networks let you hide income? Why follow labor laws when your community has its own employment networks? Why respect building codes when your religious authority says the mosque needs to be built *now* and the community will handle inspections internally?

European states find themselves unable to enforce their own laws within certain communities. Not because the laws don't apply legally, but because the enforcement mechanisms fail:

- **Police can't investigate** what they can't see - cash economies leave no trail
- **Courts can't adjudicate** disputes that never reach them - parallel legal systems handle it first
- **Regulators can't inspect** businesses operating on handshake agreements within ethnic networks
- **Tax authorities can't collect** from people whose income flows through informal channels

The state's monopoly on legitimate authority erodes. Not through revolutionary violence, but through simple non-compliance backed by community solidarity.

And what happens when authorities try to crack down? They're accused of racism, profiling, and targeting vulnerable communities. The same NGOs funded by government money lawyer up to defend those undermining state authority. The media runs stories about jackbooted thugs harassing peaceful minorities.

So authorities do what bureaucrats always do when they can't win: they stop trying. Better to ignore the problem than face accusations of bigotry.

### Ghettoization

Physical separation follows social separation.

When a community operates its own financial systems, legal structures, and information ecosystems, they don't need to interact with the broader society. Actually, they benefit from clustering together in the same neighborhoods:

- **Economic efficiency** - ethnic businesses can operate more easily when customers are concentrated
- **Social enforcement** - community norms are easier to maintain when everyone lives nearby
- **Religious requirements** - mosques, halal butchers, religious schools all benefit from density
- **Safety in numbers** - both real and perceived security comes from being surrounded by your own

This creates a feedback loop. As concentration increases, native residents leave (white flight, if you want to use the American term). As natives leave, property values drop. As values drop, more migrants move in. The neighborhood tips.

Europe's major cities now have entire districts that are functionally foreign territory. Turkish Berlin, Pakistani Birmingham, Algerian Paris, Moroccan Rotterdam. Not just high minority populations - but areas where the native language is rarely heard, where shops and services cater exclusively to the migrant community, where public space is controlled by ethnic groups.

The universalists call this "diversity" and celebrate it. They're right - it is diverse. Each ghetto is diverse in the sense that the whole city contains different cultures. But *within* the ghetto? Monoculture.

That's not integration - that's colonization with better PR.

### Fragmentation of Legal Systems

We already covered parallel religious courts, but the fragmentation goes deeper.

Different communities develop different expectations of what law means and how it should be enforced:

- **Honor codes** override written law - family reputation matters more than legal guilt
- **Collective punishment** replaces individual accountability - your cousin's actions are your responsibility
- **Restorative justice** becomes blood money - crimes can be settled through payments, not prison
- **Vigilante enforcement** supplements (or replaces) police - communities handle their own "justice"

European legal systems aren't designed for this. They assume:
- Individuals are the unit of legal responsibility, not families or clans
- State monopoly on legitimate violence
- Law is universal and applies equally
- Public court proceedings, not private settlements

When large communities reject these assumptions, the legal system doesn't just become ineffective - it becomes incomprehensible to both sides.

A prosecutor brings charges against someone for honor violence. The family doesn't understand why the state is interfering in a private family matter. The state doesn't understand why the family sees nothing wrong with punishing a member who brought shame.

Both sides think the other is crazy, because they're operating from incompatible legal paradigms.

And since the state won't admit that some populations don't share its legal values (that would be racist!), this incomprehension is never addressed. The fiction of universal law is maintained even as practice fragments into tribal justice.

### Loss of Social Trust

High-trust societies are built on certain assumptions:

- **Your neighbor shares your basic values** - you don't need to guard against fundamentally different worldviews
- **Institutions are neutral** - police, courts, schools treat everyone by the same rules
- **Social cooperation is mutually beneficial** - everyone gains from collective goods
- **Anonymity is trustworthy** - you can interact with strangers without extensive verification

Parallel societies destroy these assumptions.

When your neighbor might be operating under completely different legal and moral frameworks, trust erodes. When institutions bend rules to accommodate "cultural differences," neutrality dies. When some groups extract resources while contributing little, cooperation breaks down. When strangers might be hostile to your values, anonymity becomes threatening.

Scandinavian countries, famous for high social trust, have watched it collapse in areas with heavy migration. Swedes who used to leave their doors unlocked and trust strangers now install security systems and avoid certain neighborhoods. Not because of crime necessarily (though that's part of it), but because the **social contract has been voided**.

The Nordic social model was built on ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Not because Scandinavians are racist, but because comprehensive welfare states require high trust to function. People accept high taxes to fund generous benefits because they trust:
- Everyone is playing by the same rules
- Benefits go to legitimate recipients
- The system isn't being gamed

When parallel societies emerge that openly game the system - collecting benefits while working cash jobs in ethnic economies, claiming disability while running businesses, housing fraud through extended family networks - that trust evaporates.

You can have a welfare state, or you can have open borders. You can't have both. Europe is learning this the hard way.

### Two-Tier Policing

When parallel societies become established, law enforcement faces an impossible choice: enforce the law equally and be accused of racism, or enforce it selectively and destroy legitimacy.

Guess which option European police forces chose?

**Two-tier policing** means:

- **Different enforcement standards** - Native populations get strict enforcement, migrant communities get "cultural sensitivity"
- **Reluctance to investigate** - Crimes within migrant communities get deprioritized to avoid accusations of profiling
- **Different protest responses** - Environmental activists get arrested, religious extremists get negotiated with
- **Selective prosecution** - Hate speech laws aggressively enforced against natives, ignored for migrant communities

Examples:

- **Rotherham grooming gangs** - Police ignored mass sexual abuse for years because perpetrators were Pakistani and victims were white working class. Wouldn't want to appear racist.
- **French riots** - Cars burn in the banlieues every year. Police don't respond because entering certain neighborhoods risks escalation.
- **German New Year's assaults** - Cologne 2015/16. Mass sexual assault by migrant men. Police initially tried to suppress reports.
- **Swedish gang violence** - Bombings and shootings in immigrant areas. Police struggle to find witnesses because community doesn't cooperate.

The pattern is consistent: when enforcing law against migrant communities might cause social friction or bad press, authorities back down.

This creates a perverse incentive structure. If you're part of a parallel society, you learn that you can get away with more than native citizens. If you're a native citizen, you learn that law enforcement is only strict with you.

The social contract requires equal treatment under law. Two-tier policing destroys that. And once destroyed, legitimacy doesn't return.

### No-Go Zones

The inevitable endpoint: areas where state authority has effectively ceased to function.

The French government denies they exist. They prefer the term "*zones urbaines sensibles*" (sensitive urban zones). Much better, right? We don't have no-go zones, we have *sensitive* zones. Very diplomatic.

Except when:
- Police only enter in large numbers with tactical gear
- Ambulances require police escort to respond to emergencies  
- Firefighters get attacked when responding to (often deliberately set) fires
- Postal workers refuse to deliver to certain addresses
- Utility workers need security details for repairs

If government employees won't go somewhere without armed protection, it's a no-go zone. Call it whatever makes you feel better.

These zones emerge when parallel societies reach critical mass:
- The informal economy is large enough to be self-sustaining
- Community enforcement replaces (or supersedes) state law enforcement
- Physical territory is controlled through intimidation and violence
- Outside authority is seen as foreign occupation to be resisted

Sweden has them. France has them. Germany has them. Belgium has them. Netherlands has them.

But remember - they don't exist. If you say they exist, you're a far-right extremist. The Overton window has shifted so far that *observing reality* is now considered radical.

The zones aren't temporary either. They're expanding. Second and third-generation migrants aren't assimilating - they're doubling down on parallel society structures. Why wouldn't they? It works. They've carved out autonomous territories in the heart of Europe, and the state is too paralyzed by ideology to respond.

Give it another generation, and these won't be no-go zones. They'll just be... *not Europe*. Geographically in Europe, legally in Europe, but functionally somewhere else entirely.

## Conclusions

So there you have it. The recipe for parallel societies:

**Take** idealistic assumptions about human nature, **add** universalist ideology that denies cultural differences, **mix** with unrestricted freedom of movement and diffusion of responsibility. 

**Layer in** mechanisms for financial, legal, and informational separation - hawala, religious courts, factional media. 

**Bake** at the temperature of political correctness until enforcement becomes impossible.

**Serve** with no-go zones and terrorist attacks. *Bon appétit.*

---

The tragic irony is that this was all predictable. Every ingredient, every mechanism, every consequence - it's been documented elsewhere, at other times, in different contexts. Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Cyprus - all cautionary tales of what happens when incompatible populations are forced together and told to "embrace diversity."

But Europe's elites thought they were different. Thought they were smarter. Thought their ideology made them immune to the laws of social cohesion that apply everywhere else.

**They were wrong.**

And now Europeans are paying the price - in blood (see the *Deaths* section above), in treasure (welfare systems buckling under the strain), and in social capital (trust destroyed, institutions delegitimized).

The question isn't whether parallel societies are forming - they already have. The question is whether they're still reversible, or whether Europe has passed the point of no return.

I suspect the latter. Because reversing this requires:

1. **Admitting the problem exists** - which requires breaking ideological taboos
2. **Identifying who's responsible** - which means overcoming diffusion of responsibility  
3. **Taking decisive action** - which means confronting accusations of racism and fascism
4. **Sustaining that action** - which requires political will that democracies can't maintain

Each step is harder than the last. Most European countries can't even manage step one.

So the parallel societies will continue to grow, expand, and consolidate. The natives will continue to retreat, both physically (to areas not yet tipped) and psychologically (into denial about what's happening).

And one day, Europeans will wake up in countries that are European in name only. The demographics will have shifted, the institutions will have been captured, and the social fabric will have been irreparably fragmented.

At which point, the question won't be "How did this happen?" - we know how it happened. We watched it happen. Some of us even wrote essays explaining each step.

The question will be: "Why did we let it happen?"

And the answer will be uncomfortable: **Because stopping it would have required questioning beliefs we held sacred.**

Better to sacrifice your civilization than admit you were wrong about human nature.

That's the real recipe. Mix hubris with ideology, bake until catastrophe, serve cold.

*Ad melius futurum.* Though I'm not sure there is one.

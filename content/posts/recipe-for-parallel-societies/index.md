## Intro

In recent years, Europe has witnessed a troubling trend: the emergence of parallel societies that operate outside the bounds of traditional state authority and legal frameworks. This phenomenon is fueled by a combination of factors, including globalization, migration, and the rise of identity politics. As these parallel societies take root, they challenge the very foundations of social cohesion and democratic governance.

Here's how this came to happen - a partial explanation at best, but it covers the main components.

## Ingredients

### Idealism

### Universalism

### Tribalism

Many people like to pretend that tribalism is a thing of the past.

That it's something that only existed in ancient times, in small, isolated communities.

That it can be eradicated through education, economic development, and the spread of so-called "pluralism".

From neolithic tribes, through the fall of Rome, and to modern nation-states - tribalism has been a constant in human history. You can try to suppress it, but it will always find a way to manifest itself.

### Freedom of Movement

### Diffusion of Responsibility

## Instructions

### Hawala

### Halakha

### Sharia

### Factional Media

## Results

### Bypassing State Authority and Regulations

### Ghettoization

### Fragmentation of Legal Systems

### Loss of Social Trust

### Two-Tier Policing

### No-Go Zones

### Deaths

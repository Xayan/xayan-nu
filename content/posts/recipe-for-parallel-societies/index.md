## Intro

In recent years, Europe has witnessed a troubling trend: the emergence of parallel societies that operate outside the bounds of traditional state authority and legal frameworks. This phenomenon is fueled by a combination of factors, including globalization, migration, and the rise of identity politics. As these parallel societies take root, they challenge the very foundations of social cohesion and democratic governance.

Here's how this came to happen - a partial explanation at best, but it covers the main components.

## Ingredients

### Idealism

The first ingredient is a heavy dose of idealism - the kind that makes you believe that all humans are fundamentally good, and that any conflict or tension is just a misunderstanding waiting to be resolved through dialogue and education.

This naive worldview assumes that cultural differences are superficial, that values are negotiable, and that everyone secretly wants the same things: peace, prosperity, and progressive Western values.

It's the kind of thinking that dismisses historical patterns, ignores empirical evidence, and treats realpolitik as a dirty word. After all, who needs pragmatism when you have *good intentions*?

The idealists believe that providing welfare, education, and economic opportunities will magically dissolve cultural boundaries and transform everyone into model Western citizens. They see integration as a one-way process of assimilation - not realizing that cultures don't just blend, they compete.

### Universalism

Next, add a generous helping of universalism - the philosophical cousin of idealism.

As I explored in my piece on [the broken asylum system](/posts/asylum-system-is-broken/), **liberal universalism** operates as a quasi-religious belief system. It posits that Western democratic values aren't just *preferred* - they're *universal truths* that all humans will eventually embrace, given the right circumstances.

This worldview refuses to acknowledge that some cultures have fundamentally incompatible values. That some societies don't value individual liberty over collective identity. That some belief systems don't separate church and state, or law and religion.

The universalists see cultural relativism as a temporary condition, not a permanent state. They believe that exposure to Western institutions will inevitably lead to convergence on Western values. Any resistance is dismissed as ignorance, poverty, or manipulation by bad actors.

It's an oddly colonial mindset for people who claim to oppose colonialism. They want to reshape the world in their image, but call it "liberation" instead of conquest.

### Tribalism

Many people like to pretend that tribalism is a thing of the past.

That it's something that only existed in ancient times, in small, isolated communities.

That it can be eradicated through education, economic development, and the spread of so-called "pluralism".

From neolithic tribes, through the fall of Rome, and to modern nation-states - tribalism has been a constant in human history. You can try to suppress it, but it will always find a way to manifest itself.

### Freedom of Movement

Now we need a mechanism for turning theoretical idealism into practical chaos: unrestricted freedom of movement.

The Schengen Agreement abolished internal borders in much of Europe, creating a zone where anyone can travel freely. Combined with asylum frameworks that make deportation nearly impossible, this creates a one-way valve: easy to enter, hard to remove.

This isn't just about migration numbers - it's about the *type* of migration. When movement is unrestricted and residency is guaranteed through asylum claims (valid or not), you don't get the self-selected, highly-motivated immigrants who integrate successfully. You get a mix that includes people who have no intention of integrating at all.

The system actively selects for those willing to game it. The honest migrant who applies through legal channels and waits years gets passed by the one who crosses illegally and claims asylum. The person who wants to adopt Western values competes for resources with those who want to recreate their home country's social structures.

Freedom of movement without freedom to exclude is just an invitation to be colonized in reverse.

### Diffusion of Responsibility

The final ingredient is diffusion of responsibility - a bureaucratic masterpiece where nobody is accountable because everyone shares the blame.

When decisions about migration, asylum, and integration are made at multiple levels - EU, national, regional, local - with overlapping jurisdictions and contradictory mandates, you create a system where no single actor can be held responsible for failures.

The EU sets broad policies but can't enforce them. National governments complain they're constrained by EU law. Local authorities say they're just implementing national policy. NGOs operate with government funding but claim independence. International organizations issue non-binding recommendations that somehow become binding through judicial interpretation.

This diffusion serves a purpose: it insulates policymakers from consequences. When a policy fails - when parallel societies emerge, when integration doesn't happen, when social tensions rise - there's always someone else to blame.

The voters can't punish their government because "Brussels made us do it." Brussels can't be punished because it's not directly elected on these issues. The courts can't be touched because they're "independent." And the whole machine keeps grinding forward, because stopping it would require someone to take responsibility.

Nobody steers the ship, but everyone insists they're just following orders.

## Instructions

### Hawala

**Hawala** is an informal value transfer system that operates entirely outside the traditional banking infrastructure. No paper trail, no regulatory oversight, just trust-based networks that move money across borders invisibly.

Here's how it works: You give cash to a hawaladar in Berlin. He contacts his associate in Karachi. The associate pays out the equivalent amount to your family. No banks, no records, no taxes, no questions. The debt between the two hawaladars is settled later through other transactions or legitimate trade.

For parallel societies, this is perfect. It enables:

- **Tax evasion** - Income earned in Europe never appears in any official records
- **Sanctions bypass** - Money flows to and from countries under embargo
- **Terror financing** - Funds reach destinations without triggering any alerts  
- **Economic isolation** - Entire communities can operate financially separate from the host country

European authorities know about hawala networks but struggle to combat them. How do you prosecute a system that leaves no evidence? How do you infiltrate networks built on family and tribal bonds that span generations?

The beautiful irony: the same freedom of movement that allows people to migrate also allows money to flow back, sustaining economic ties to home countries and preventing integration.

### Halakha

**Halakha** - Jewish religious law - provides the template for religious legal systems operating alongside secular law.

In some Orthodox Jewish communities across Europe, rabbinical courts (*batei din*) handle disputes over marriage, divorce, inheritance, and business matters. These rulings carry social weight within the community, even when they contradict secular law.

The system relies on voluntary submission - theoretically. In practice, social pressure and community enforcement make these courts almost mandatory for observant members. Refusing to accept a rabbinical court's judgment can mean ostracization, loss of business relationships, and exclusion from community institutions.

This isn't necessarily problematic when the community is small and self-regulating. But it establishes a precedent: **religious law can coexist with, and sometimes supersede, state law.**

The pattern:
1. Community establishes religious courts for "internal matters"
2. Social pressure makes participation effectively mandatory
3. Religious rulings contradict secular law but are enforced through informal means
4. State authorities tolerate it in the name of religious freedom
5. The parallel legal system becomes institutionalized

What works for Halakha can work for any religious legal system. The framework is portable.

### Sharia

**Sharia** - Islamic law - scales the halakha model to much larger populations with a crucial difference: it explicitly claims superiority over secular law.

Across European cities, sharia councils and Islamic arbitration tribunals operate semi-openly. They handle family law, inheritance, finance, and increasingly, criminal matters through "restorative justice."

Unlike halakha, which generally accepts its subordinate position to state law (even if grudgingly), sharia courts often operate on the premise that Islamic law is divinely mandated and therefore superior to man-made legislation. This creates a fundamentally different dynamic.

Case study: the UK officially recognizes sharia councils as alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Sounds reasonable - voluntary arbitration, right? Except:

- Women are pressured by families to accept sharia tribunals instead of secular courts
- Sharia divorce often grants women fewer rights than UK law
- "Voluntary" submission isn't so voluntary when community enforcement mechanisms are in play
- The same institutions issuing rulings also control access to Islamic marriage, making compliance essential

Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands - all have similar systems developing. Each country insists these are just "voluntary" religious services, not parallel legal systems.

But when a woman in Berlin can't get remarried in her community without a sharia divorce, when a man in Marseille is socially punished for taking a dispute to French courts instead of an imam, when community enforcement makes secular law irrelevant - you have a parallel legal system, whether you admit it or not.

The mechanisms are identical to halakha, just implemented at a scale that makes them impossible to ignore.

### Factional Media

The final mechanism: **media ecosystems that operate entirely separate from mainstream discourse.**

Parallel societies don't just need parallel legal and financial systems - they need parallel information ecosystems. When communities consume media exclusively in their heritage language, from sources in their countries of origin or from diaspora outlets, they inhabit a different reality than their neighbors.

A Turk in Berlin watches TRT, follows Turkish Twitter, and discusses politics on Turkish WhatsApp groups. His information diet is entirely Turkish, his reference points are Turkish politics, his enemies are Turkey's enemies. Germany is just where he happens to live and collect welfare.

An Arab in Paris gets news from Al Jazeera, entertainment from Arabic satellite TV, religious instruction from YouTube imams. French current events are filtered through Arabic-language diaspora media that frames everything through grievance narratives.

This isn't just about language - it's about **reality tunnels**. When your media tells you that Europeans are crusaders, that Western law is corrupt, that your community is perpetually victimized, that integration is cultural genocide - you don't integrate. You resist.

The mainstream European media helps by:
- Refusing to report accurately on migrant crime (for fear of "racism")
- Amplifying grievance narratives to demonstrate progressive credentials
- Treating any criticism of parallel societies as far-right extremism
- Providing ammunition for diaspora media's victim narratives

Social media accelerated this process. Now you don't even need satellite dishes. Facebook groups, Telegram channels, WhatsApp networks - entire communities can communicate, organize, and radicalize without ever engaging with the host society's information sphere.

When you control the information ecosystem, you control reality. And when different communities inhabit different realities, they aren't living in the same society - they're just occupying the same geography.

## Intro

In recent years, Europe has witnessed a troubling trend: the emergence of parallel societies that operate outside the bounds of traditional state authority and legal frameworks. This phenomenon is fueled by a combination of factors, including globalization, migration, and the rise of identity politics. As these parallel societies take root, they challenge the very foundations of social cohesion and democratic governance.

Here's how this came to happen - a partial explanation at best, but it covers the main components.

## Ingredients

### Idealism

The first ingredient is a heavy dose of idealism - the kind that makes you believe that all humans are fundamentally good, and that any conflict or tension is just a misunderstanding waiting to be resolved through dialogue and education.

This naive worldview assumes that cultural differences are superficial, that values are negotiable, and that everyone secretly wants the same things: peace, prosperity, and progressive Western values.

It's the kind of thinking that dismisses historical patterns, ignores empirical evidence, and treats realpolitik as a dirty word. After all, who needs pragmatism when you have *good intentions*?

The idealists believe that providing welfare, education, and economic opportunities will magically dissolve cultural boundaries and transform everyone into model Western citizens. They see integration as a one-way process of assimilation - not realizing that cultures don't just blend, they compete.

### Universalism

Next, add a generous helping of universalism - the philosophical cousin of idealism.

As I explored in my piece on [the broken asylum system](/posts/asylum-system-is-broken/), **liberal universalism** operates as a quasi-religious belief system. It posits that Western democratic values aren't just *preferred* - they're *universal truths* that all humans will eventually embrace, given the right circumstances.

This worldview refuses to acknowledge that some cultures have fundamentally incompatible values. That some societies don't value individual liberty over collective identity. That some belief systems don't separate church and state, or law and religion.

The universalists see cultural relativism as a temporary condition, not a permanent state. They believe that exposure to Western institutions will inevitably lead to convergence on Western values. Any resistance is dismissed as ignorance, poverty, or manipulation by bad actors.

It's an oddly colonial mindset for people who claim to oppose colonialism. They want to reshape the world in their image, but call it "liberation" instead of conquest.

### Tribalism

Many people like to pretend that tribalism is a thing of the past.

That it's something that only existed in ancient times, in small, isolated communities.

That it can be eradicated through education, economic development, and the spread of so-called "pluralism".

From neolithic tribes, through the fall of Rome, and to modern nation-states - tribalism has been a constant in human history. You can try to suppress it, but it will always find a way to manifest itself.

### Freedom of Movement

Now we need a mechanism for turning theoretical idealism into practical chaos: unrestricted freedom of movement.

The Schengen Agreement abolished internal borders in much of Europe, creating a zone where anyone can travel freely. Combined with asylum frameworks that make deportation nearly impossible, this creates a one-way valve: easy to enter, hard to remove.

This isn't just about migration numbers - it's about the *type* of migration. When movement is unrestricted and residency is guaranteed through asylum claims (valid or not), you don't get the self-selected, highly-motivated immigrants who integrate successfully. You get a mix that includes people who have no intention of integrating at all.

The system actively selects for those willing to game it. The honest migrant who applies through legal channels and waits years gets passed by the one who crosses illegally and claims asylum. The person who wants to adopt Western values competes for resources with those who want to recreate their home country's social structures.

Freedom of movement without freedom to exclude is just an invitation to be colonized in reverse.

### Diffusion of Responsibility

The final ingredient is diffusion of responsibility - a bureaucratic masterpiece where nobody is accountable because everyone shares the blame.

When decisions about migration, asylum, and integration are made at multiple levels - EU, national, regional, local - with overlapping jurisdictions and contradictory mandates, you create a system where no single actor can be held responsible for failures.

The EU sets broad policies but can't enforce them. National governments complain they're constrained by EU law. Local authorities say they're just implementing national policy. NGOs operate with government funding but claim independence. International organizations issue non-binding recommendations that somehow become binding through judicial interpretation.

This diffusion serves a purpose: it insulates policymakers from consequences. When a policy fails - when parallel societies emerge, when integration doesn't happen, when social tensions rise - there's always someone else to blame.

The voters can't punish their government because "Brussels made us do it." Brussels can't be punished because it's not directly elected on these issues. The courts can't be touched because they're "independent." And the whole machine keeps grinding forward, because stopping it would require someone to take responsibility.

Nobody steers the ship, but everyone insists they're just following orders.

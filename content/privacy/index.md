## Who We Are

This website ("the Site") is operated by Damian (an individual). This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## What We Collect

* **Analytics:**
  We use [Umami](https://umami.is/) and [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) analytics to measure site traffic and performance. These tools collect anonymized usage data such as page views, device/browser info, and approximate location (city/country). No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored in analytics.
* **Comments:**
  Comments are provided by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which requires you to log in with your GitHub account to comment. When commenting, your GitHub username and profile may be visible publicly.
  Giscus is governed by GitHubâ€™s privacy policy. We do not collect or store your GitHub data ourselves.
* **Cookies:**
  We may use cookies as required by Umami, Cloudflare, or for basic site functionality. You can disable cookies in your browser.

## How We Use Data

* To monitor site performance, understand visitor usage, and improve content.
* To enable and display public comments via Giscus.
* We do **not** sell, rent, or share your information with any third parties.

## Data Storage & Transfers

* Analytics data is stored securely by Umami and Cloudflare.
* Comments via Giscus are stored by GitHub, not us.
* Some analytics or comment data may be transferred and processed outside the EU, depending on your location and the location of these service providers.

## Your Rights

You can request deletion or correction of any personal data we hold about you.

Since we do not directly collect or store your personal data, requests for deletion or correction must be made directly to the third-party services we use:

* **Giscus:** Governed by GitHub's privacy policy. You can manage your comments and data through your GitHub account.
* **Umami & Cloudflare:** These services collect anonymized data only, with no personal information tied to them.

## Third-Party Links

We may link to third-party sites (e.g., Reddit, GitHub, etc.). We are not responsible for their privacy policies.

## Updates

This policy may change. Updates will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date.
